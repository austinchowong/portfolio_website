							<h1>Swing of the Valkyries</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/swing.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I was thrilled to design, write, and program my first 3D Unreal Engine Game - it was a challenge, but it helped grow my skillset a lot! I've become very comfortable using Blueprints since this project, even for unfamiliar use cases.</p>

							<h2>Highlights</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>3D World Generation & Swing Traversal: I used blueprints to create dynamically generated worlds for the player to traverse in style via physics-based spider-swinging. Ensured no two runs would be the same, but that each run would be possible to win.</li>
						<li>3D Combat Design: I designed & programmed multiple enemies with different AI patterns to obstruct the player, but with predictable enough patterns for skilled players to avoid & defeat.</li>
						<li>Environmental Storytelling: Since it was my first opportuninty making a 3D game, I took full liberty to mix automatic world generation with handcrafted assets to imply the narrative of previous events (e.g. logs, writing, outline marks in the shape of a person)</li>

					</ul>
