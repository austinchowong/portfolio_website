							<p>I was thrilled to be a part of the team at Uken Games. Due to the small size of the studio, I got to try my hand at all of narrative design, game design, and technical design, all at the same time!</p>

							<h2>Highlights</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Event Design: I designed the narrative and gameplay for multiple in-game events, which drove 20% increased daily engagement and increased LTV by 15%.</li>
						<li>Dynamic Difficulty Design: I designed and balanced a dynamic difficulty system that increased engagement by 50% and LTV by 30%. The key was making sure players had a good experience, regardless of skill level. Losing all the time feels terrible, but only winning takes away any challenge and bores players.</li>
						<li>Data Schema Design v2: I worked alongside developers to redesign the data schemas of the game to make it much easier for analysts & designers to evaluate how the game was performing, and made it so that the same queries could be used for both Millionaire and Jeopardy!  This saved 3 weeks of time rebuilding dashboards, which is critical during launch.</li>

					</ul>
