							<p>My first foray into writing and designing a procedural narrative was both exciting and challenging! Unlike a classic choose-your-own-adventure, this game has multiiple narrative threads that would proceed at different speeds based on a player's performance in a roguelite loop.</p>

							<h2>Highlights</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Dynamic Narrative Development: Designed & wrote multiple plotlines that would proceed based on the player's performance and achievements during roguelite runs.</li>
						<li>Difficulty Balancing: Balanced & designed the roguelite run based on data analysis & player feedback to ensure player engagement for players of all skill levels, as well as continued story progression for the player.</li>
						<li>Writing for multiple demographics: Wrote the narrative in a way simple enough for children to enjoy, but with some fun hidden jokes for adults.</li>

					</ul>
